# There are several ways for connecting the led with the aruino and bread board 
## 1- First method
1. Led anode(+) longest leg -> pin 
2. Led cathod(-) -> resistor 
3. resistor free end with -> GND

## 2- second method 
1.  Led anode(+) longest leg -> resistor  (The resistor can be connected on either side of the LED; it just needs to be in series)
2. Led cathod(-) -> GND 
3. resistor free end with -> pin
